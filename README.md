This is a drop in replacement for FVTTs default rich text editor (TinyMCE).  
While switching between the original editor and this one does not result in bugs, it will behave like so:
* Content created through TinyMCE will be displayed correctly in the markdown editor, when previewing. While editing you will see the original HTML.
* Markdown written through the markdown editor will not be parsed to the correct HTML output, when switching back to the default editor, TinyMCE. But it will not cause problems.

# Important Information!
## Beta Version
This module is Beta. I do feel quite confident that it does work and doesn't break stuff, but please still be careful.  
*Also this means: I'm in big need of feedback! Tell me what is awesome, what doesn't work and/or what you'd like to improve upon!*

## Style problems? System/sheet/.. not supported?
If your system/sheet/... has some styling issues with this editor, please contact me aboutb it and **ideally** send me the css to fix it! I'll be happy to incorporate it. But i can't check every module or system myself, there are to many.

## Bug Reporting
Go to the [GitHub's issue board](https://github.com/Moerill/fvtt-markdown-editor/issues) and check if the Bug is already reported. If not first test with all other modules disabled! If the bug persists create a new issue, with at least the following information:
1. Module version
2. FVTT version
3. Browser and OS used. Or if the app itself is used.
4. Bug description
	- What happened?
	- What should've happened?
	- Console errors? (F12 or F11 in most browsers)
5. Workflow to recreate the bug
6. Helpful videos or screenshots if possible
7. Either activate notifications, stay active or post your discord handle so i can get back to you for further questions  

**I will only take a quick glance at half hearted bug reports or Discord mentions! Don't expect me to react there!**

## Atribution
This module uses and partially modifies the following libraries:
* [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor)
